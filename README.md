#### About:

This script will do the following:

*   Download and install Waterfox version G3.2.6
*   Disable automatic updates for Waterfox as any update will break Flash support
*   Download and install PPAPI Flash Plug-Ins version 34.0.0.242

---

#### A couple of notes before you get started:

*   This script will only work on MacOS.
*   The script will ask for your password as some actions require elevated privileges.
*   It is not recommended to use the browser for anything other than Flash content as you will no longer get security updates.
